# Neutron Thermalization Simulator

The model developed aims to simulate the behaviour of neutrons generated by secondary cosmic radiation during their interaction with the soil, consid- ering variations in humidity, chemical composition, porosity and density. The developed simulator uses a Monte Carlo approach to model neutron transport, implementing a particle-by-particle simulation that follows each neutron through its history of interactions in the soil, each neutron: 
   1. Is generated with random energy sampled from the PARMA spectrum (loaded from SpectrumCurrent.csv) and with an isotropic direction in the upper hemisphere.
   2. Penetrates the soil and undergoes stochastic interactions with energy degradation simulated according to nuclear kinematics.
   3. The position, energy and number of collisions of the neutron are tracked until thermalisation, absorption or backscattering.

Features:
- Based on customizable soil composition
- Includes elastic scattering and neutron absorption
- Supports realistic energy spectra (PARMA)
- Outputs include thermalization depths, backscatter energies, and full diagnostics
- Interactive CLI interface with configuration saving/loading
