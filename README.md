# Neutron Thermalization Simulator

The model developed aims to simulate the behaviour of neutrons generated by secondary cosmic radiation during their interaction with the soil, considering variations in humidity, chemical composition, porosity and density. The developed simulator uses a Monte Carlo approach to model neutron transport, implementing a particle-by-particle simulation that follows each neutron through its history of interactions in the soil:
   1. Each neutron is generated with random energy sampled from the PARMA spectrum (loaded from SpectrumCurrent.csv) and with an isotropic direction in the upper hemisphere.
   2. It penetrates the soil and undergoes stochastic interactions with energy degradation simulated according to nuclear kinematics.
   3. The position, energy and number of collisions of the neutron are tracked until thermalisation, absorption or backscattering.
