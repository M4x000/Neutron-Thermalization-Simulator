# Neutron Thermalization Simulator

A Monte Carlo simulator for modeling the thermalization of cosmic-ray neutrons in soil, with variable humidity, porosity, density and chemical composition.

- Based on customizable soil composition
- Includes elastic scattering and neutron absorption
- Supports realistic energy spectra (PARMA)
- Outputs include thermalization depths, backscatter energies, and full diagnostics
- Interactive CLI interface with configuration saving/loading
